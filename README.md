## About
This repository contains the code of a PaddlePaddle implementation of STGCN based on the paper Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875, with a few modifications in the model architecture to tackle with traffic jam forecasting problems.
